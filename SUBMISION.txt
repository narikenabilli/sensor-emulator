PREDIX SENSOR EMULATION IN C++
==============================

Verification
------------

  * Tested in:
    - Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS with GCC 5.4
    - Windows 7 with MS VS 2017
    - MacOSX "Sierra" with XCode 

  * Follow the README.md file to setup, build and run the application.
    - The Predix setup is fully automated, requiring the user to run a Python script after 
      installing requirements with "pip".

  * Let it run for a while. It should:
    - Fetch an OAuth2 access token using UAA
    - Emulate sensor data "sampling" and queue for sending to Predix.
    - In a another thread, a "sender" send the messages in the queue to Predix.

  * Bonus features:
    - You can check the code to see that the network I/O does block the periodic sampling.
    - You can disable your networking while the program is running and reconnect. It will 
      keep sampling and try to reconnect until it successful, then send multiple messages.

  * Verification server:
    - You can check the data was correctly sent to Predix and can be queried by using the
      bundled verification server.
    - The server is installed and configured automatically as part of the Python setup 
      script.
    - To get the server URL, call `bin/cf apps` and check the URL of the `tc-predix` app.
      Then access at `https://<tc-predix-url>`. After a while it should show some of the
      uploaded data. Note: mind the HTTPS, it will not work in regular HTTP.

  * Cleanup:
    - Call "python setup/predix_setup.py --clean" to cleanup the Predix environment, in
      case you want to test the code in other OS.
